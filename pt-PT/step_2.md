## Finding the compass direction

The Sense HAT contains a magnetometer that can be used to work out which direction is North.

In the emulator North corresponds to the top of your screen. The Sense HAT reports a compass heading in degrees from North.

Here's a reminder of the points of a compass:

    In its starting position the Sense HAT is facing east and you should see values of about 90 degrees.
    
    The direction is based on the USB ports.

+ Drag the Sense HAT around to change its direction.

    Try finding different directions:
    
    + North: Around 360 or 0 degrees 
    + East: Around 90 degrees
    + South: Around 180 degrees
    + West: Around 270 degrees

+ If you get in a muddle you can always click the reset button to put the Sense HAT back into its starting position.
