## Увод:

In this project you will use the the Sense HAT as a compass to navigate out of a maze of colourful rooms. You will need to point the Sense HAT in the direction you want to move and then press the button in the middle of the joystick to make a move.

</div>

To play the game press Run and read the text that appears in the trinket output window.

Your current compass direction will appear on the Sense HAT display (N, S, E or W.) You can change direction by moving the Sense HAT in the emulator.

When you are facing in the direction you want to go, press the middle button on the joystick by pressing enter on the keyboard.

## Увод:

In this project, children will learn how to use the Sense HAT magnetometer (compass), and use the compass direction to navigate through a maze.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Compass Maze' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/compass-go](http://jumpto.cc/compass-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

* [‘Compass Maze’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/d11bf21615](https://trinket.io/python/d11bf21615)

## Offline Resources

This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* compass-maze/main.py
* compass-maze/maze.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* compass-maze-finished/main.py
* compass-maze-finished/maze.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* How to use the Sense HAT magnetometer (`get_compass()`)

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* "Reward the player" - Displaying n image on the LEDs at the end of the game;
* "Create your own maze" - edit the maze dictionary to create their own maze.
